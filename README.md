## Overview

This project is a full-stack application featuring a back-end server created with Node.js and Express, integrated with MongoDB for data storage. The server provides a RESTful API to the front-end, which is built with React.js. This README file serves as a guide for setting up, developing, testing, and deploying the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (and Mongoose for object modeling)
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Package Management:** npm or yarn
- **Version Control:** Git

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Structured routes for CRUD operations.
- **Middleware Integration:** Logging, error handling, and security enhancements.
- **Database Integration:** Mongoose ODM for schema definition and database interactions.
- **React Integration:** Seamless data flow from the backend API to the React front-end.
- **Environment Configuration:** Support for environment variables to configure development, testing, and production environments.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Modular code structure to facilitate extension and maintenance.

## Prerequisites

Before installing and running this project, ensure that you have installed the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (installed locally or access to a hosted MongoDB instance)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git
   cd your-project-name
Install Dependencies:

Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install
# or if using yarn
yarn install
Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
npm install
# or if using yarn
yarn install
Configuration
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following environment-specific configurations:

dotenv
Copy
Edit
# .env file in backend folder
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
Additional Configuration:

Ensure that any configuration files or scripts required for connecting to your database or setting up middleware are properly referenced in your project.

Running the Application
Backend Server
To start the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
# In the backend directory
npm run start
# or for development with auto-reloading:
npm run dev
Note: Ensure that MongoDB is running on your local system or that the connection string in your .env file points to a live MongoDB instance.

Frontend Application
To run the React.js front-end:

bash
Copy
Edit
# In the frontend directory
npm start
The front-end development server will typically run on port 3000 and proxy API requests to the backend.
